# Nerve

Nerve is a utility for tracking the status of machines and services.
It runs locally on the boxes which make up a distributed system, and reports state information to a distributed key-value store.
At Airbnb, we use Zookeeper as our key-value store.
The combination of Nerve and [Synapse](https://github.com/airbnb/synapse) make service discovery in the cloud easy!

## Motivation ##

We already use [Synapse](https://github.com/airbnb/synapse) to discover remote services.
However, those services needed boilerplate code to register themselves in [Zookeeper](http://zookeeper.apache.org/).
Nerve simplifies underlying services, enables code reuse, and allows us to create a more composable system.
It does so by factoring out the boilerplate into it's own application, which independenly handles monitoring and reporting.

Beyond those benefits, nerve also acts as a general watchdog on systems.
The information it reports can be used to take action from a certralized automation center: action like scaling distributed systems up or down or alerting ops or engineering about downtime.

## Installation ##

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'nerve'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install nerve

## Configuration ##

Nerve depends on a single configuration file, in json format.
It is usually called `nerve.conf.json`.
An example config file is available in `example/nerve.conf.json`.
The config file is composed of two main sections:

* `instance_id`: the name nerve will submit when registering services; makes debugging easier
* `services`: the hash (from service name to config) of the services nerve will be monitoring
* `service_conf_dir`: path to a directory in which each json file will be interpreted as a service with the basename of the file minus the .json extension

### Services Config ###

Each service that nerve will be monitoring is specified in the `services` hash.
The key is the name of the service, and the value is a configuration hash telling nerve how to monitor the service.
The configuration contains the following options:

* `host`: the default host on which to make service checks; you should make this your *public* ip to ensure your service is publically accessible
* `port`: the default port for service checks; nerve will report the `host`:`port` combo via your chosen reporter
* `reporter_type`: the mechanism used to report up/down information; depending on the reporter you choose, additional parameters may be required. Defaults to `zookeeper`
* `check_interval`: the frequency with which service checks will be initiated; defaults to `500ms`
* `checks`: a list of checks that nerve will perform; if all of the pass, the service will be registered; otherwise, it will be un-registered

#### Zookeeper Reporter ####

If you set your `reporter_type` to `"zookeeper"` you should also set these parameters:

* `zk_hosts`: a list of the zookeeper hosts comprising the [ensemble](https://zookeeper.apache.org/doc/r3.1.2/zookeeperAdmin.html#sc_zkMulitServerSetup) that nerve will submit registration to
* `zk_path`: the path (or [znode](https://zookeeper.apache.org/doc/r3.1.2/zookeeperProgrammers.html#sc_zkDataModel_znodes)) where the registration will be created; nerve will create the [ephemeral node](https://zookeeper.apache.org/doc/r3.1.2/zookeeperProgrammers.html#Ephemeral+Nodes) that is the registration as a child of this path

#### Etcd Reporter ####

Note: Etcd support is currently experimental! 

If you set your `reporter_type` to `"etcd"` you should also set these parameters:

* `etcd_host`: etcd host that nerve will submit registration to
* `etcd_port`: port to connect to etcd.
* `etcd_path`: the path where the registration will be created; nerve will create a node with a 30s ttl that is the registration as a child of this path, and then update it every few seconds

### Checks ###

The core of nerve is a set of service checks.
Each service can define a number of checks, and all of them must pass for the service to be registered.
Although the exact parameters passed to each check are different, all take a number of common arguments:

* `type`: (required) the kind of check; you can see available check types in the `lib/nerve/service_watcher` dir of this repo
* `name`: (optional) a descriptive, human-readable name for the check; it will be auto-generated based on the other parameters if not specified
* `host`: (optional) the host on which the check will be performed; defaults to the `host` of the service to which the check belongs
* `port`: (optional) the port on which the check will be performed; like `host`, it defaults to the `port` of the service
* `timeout`: (optional) maximum time the check can take; defaults to `100ms`
* `rise`: (optional) how many consecutive checks must pass before the check is considered passing; defaults to 1
* `fall`: (optional) how many consecutive checks must fail before the check is considered failing; defaults to 1
